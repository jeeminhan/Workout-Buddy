TODO - Add functionality to check that camera is right angle 
TODO - Default user
TODO - Add ding sound for each pushup done
TODO - Change angle of camera




Notes - Parameters for determining if a push-up is valid
- Depth (how low you go)
- Hips being too high
- Arms being too wide
- Angle of elbow being around 45 degrees

Might try to implement criteria for a side view of pushup such as "depth" and "straight back"
